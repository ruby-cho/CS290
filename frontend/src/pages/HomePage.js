            <p>Hi, I'm Minji, and my career goal is to become a skilled software engineer that can contribute to exciting projects!</p>
            <p>
                The main technologies that I used to create this website are:
                <ol><li>Node: a runtime environment used for developing server-side and networking apps which can be written in JavaScript and run within the Node.js runtime environment. It can make developing web apps much simpler.</li>
                <li>JavaScript: A high-level, just-in-time compiled language and scripting language that enables user to create dynamic content, multimedia, images and animation in websites. </li>
                <li>HTML:HyperText Markup Language, code used to structure web pages and their content.  </li>
                <li>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets, a computer language used to create layout and structure for webpages. It determines how content is displayed or rendered on the screen.</li>
                <li>Express: A node.js web application framework that provides broad features for building web or mobile applications. It is like a layer built atop the Node.js that helps manage servers and the routes that connect to them, helping simplify APIs and add new features to websites.</li>
                <li>MongoDB: A document database that allows developers to process, transform, and analyze data with great scalability and flexibility.</li>
                <li>Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) JavaScript library for MongoDB and Node.js that provides a syntactic layer between the data in databases and the objects of a Node app, making it easier for apps to interact with MongoDB. </li>
                <li>React: A framework for writing frontend applications that creates a component tree from 'components', or reusable units of UI, and maps to the real DOM tree that a browser displays. </li></ol>
